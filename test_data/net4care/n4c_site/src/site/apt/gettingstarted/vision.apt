The Vision of Net4Care
~~~

  The research project Net4Care's aim is to develop a ecosystem to
  make it easy for small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) to build
  telemedical applications for the home.

  The main area of support within the present edition is handling
  clinical observations in the home and ensuring they become available
  for clinician's work. A typical end-user scenario is: 

*-----* 
Knud has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; KOL in
 Danish). Several times a day, he blows hard in the spirometry device
 that is connected to his small Net4Care-enabled device. On the
 device, he can see simple graphs that plots the measured values over
 the last week. More importantly, the values are uploaded to national
 XDS repositories as standardized HL7 clinical documents, allowing his
 general practitioner (GP) to view the data, as can clinicians at his
 regional hospital. | 
*-----*

  While this scenario is a classic one and supported by many projects,
  the central vision of Net4Care is to make it <easy and simple> to
  develop the software for such home devices. Thus, a main goal of
  Net4Care is expressed in the following scenario:

*-----*
  An SMB developer with a strong background in embedded systems wants
  to develop a telemedical application for the home that supports
  uploading measured clinical values. He wants to explore and
  prototype a solution and chooses to use the Net4Care framework
  framework as part of preliminary exploration and prototyping. Within
  four staff hours, the framework is downloaded and installed and he
  has tested a first prototype having a full round-trip of clinical
  measurements (from device to simulated server and back again). |
*-----*

  The Net4Care framework helps in this by providing 

    * <A Java-based framework that hides clinical complexity>, and
      lets developers focus on designing good user interfaces and
      implementing connections to medical devices, instead of
      spending large efforts on understanding XDS and HL7 standards.

    * <Learning material for a quick start>. Tutorials, source code
      examples, and demonstrator applications are provided. These help
      SMB developers to understand, design, and implement home
      telemedical applications in general, and insight into the
      specific clinical aspects in particular.

    * <Support for safe experimentation with staged development>. A
      staged development environment that allows the SMB developers to
      safely experiment with and develop their applications without
      all the hazzles of setting up a distributed environment is
      provided. Later, they can gradually move to a local distributed
      environment, further on to connect to Net4Care testing servers,
      before finally committing to full production quality
      applications that interact with the live medical servers.

    * <Servers that SMBs may use to host medical services>. A set of
      Net4Care servers that bridge regional and national XDS
      repositories as well as other medical services is provided. Thus
      there is no need for a SMB to create its own server software nor
      run a server farm.
