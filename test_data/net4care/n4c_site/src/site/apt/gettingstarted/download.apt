  aspects in which there may be inconsistencies and bugs. Any comments
  and feedback is very welcome!

  Anonymous Subversion access is possible. To access the very latest
  version checkout from the URL:

+--
http://svn.nfit.au.dk/svn/net4care/trunk/src/net4care
+--

  To access a specific version, checkout from the URL:

+--
http://svn.nfit.au.dk/svn/net4care/branches/<branch>
+--

 (Here, <<<<branch>>>> is one of the branches from the table above.)

Building the source distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Net4care framework is based upon Java and (Apache Felix)
  OSGi. To build, you need to have {{{http://maven.apache.org}Apache
  Maven}} installed to build Net4Care.

  Be sure that your Maven version is 3.x or later (We have experienced
  that some Linuxes by default install Maven 2.x that fail to compile
  the code.)

  Unzip the distribution in some suitable directory, change working
  directory to the root directory (named: net4care), and, using Maven,
  execute the following in a shell:

+-----
  mvn install
+-----

  This will build, run tests, and install (in the local Maven
  repository), the Net4Care bundles and support for creating new
  projects.

  The distribution has been tested on Windows 7, Ubuntu 12 LTS
  (desktop and server edition), and Mac OS X.

Using Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you want to experiment and develop
  using {{{http://www.eclipse.org}Eclipse}}, you can create Eclipse
  project files for the project using

+---
  mvn eclipse:eclipse
+---

  This has been tested on Eclipse Indigo. As each bundle is a separate
  Eclipse project, we recommend using the "Working set" feature to group
  these projects.

  If things gets messed up, you can try removing the project files
  ("mvn eclipse:clean") and then generate them again.



Moving on
~~

   First, read the {{{./hello.html}Hello, World!}} tutorial to view
  and execute a simple example of using the Net4Care framework for
  uploading and querying simple tele observations.

  Next, move on with the {{{./learning.html}Learning Net4Care}}
  tutorial and associated tutorials under the "Application
  Development" menu.

  Finally, the "Framework Development" and "Documentation" menu have
  links to more detailed information.
