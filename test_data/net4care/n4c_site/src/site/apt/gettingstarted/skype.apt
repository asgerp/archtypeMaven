Using Skype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The net4care framework comes with {{{http://developer.skype.com/}SkypeKit SDK}} '
  (currently version 4.1.2) and some of their 
  tutorial code which is modified to increase ease of use. This means 
  that when learning to develop a Skype enabled application, then the 
  Skype developer page is a good place to start but there will be some 
  differences in the structure when moving on to Net4Care Skype. These 
  differences will be explained further under {{{../developing/skypeap.html#Net4Care_Skype_deviations}Net4Care Skype deviation}} located under 
  the application development section.
  
  To see examples of how to use Skype in the context of Net4Care go to the {{Demonstration}} section of this page but if 
  you are new to Net4Care Skype then it is recommended to keep reading.

* Before you begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In order to develop an application using Skype you will need to:
  
  [[1]] Register as developer at {{{http://developer.skype.com/}Skype developer site}}
  
  [[2]] Join the program for SkypeKit Desktop development
  
  [[3]] Request and download a Skype Runtime matching the version of Net4Care Skype (currently version 4.1.2). This is an executable file.
  
  [[4]] Request and download a developer keypair
  
  [] 
  
  All these steps are explained in detail at the {{{http://developer.skype.com/}Skype developer site}}. Furthermore the 
  keypair 'myKeyPair.pem' needs a 'myKeyPair.der' to represent a valid keypair and to generate 'myKeyPair.der'
  
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
  openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -inform PEM -outform DER -in myKeyPair.pem -out myKeyPair.der 
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

  See {{{http://developer.skype.com/skypekit/development-guide/java-tutorial/tutorial-guide-java}Skype java tutorial guide}} for further details.
  
  You will need to have maven installed {{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html} download maven here}}.
  
  <<Note:>> Remember to add MAVEN_HOME\bin to your PATH environment variable. 
  
  <<Note:>> If you experience problems with maven being 
  stuck at downloading dependencies, you might need to use JRE 1.6 instead of JRE 1.7. 
  
  If you develop using eclipse it is recommended that you install the maven to eclipse plugin: {{{http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/}m2e}}.

* Integrating Skype in your Net4Care installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Simply install net4care using maven:
  
+------------------------------------------------------------+
	/path_to_net4care/mvn install
+------------------------------------------------------------+  

 And net4care skype is now available using the following dependency:
  
+------------------------------------------------------------+  

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.net4care</groupId>
	  	<artifactId>n4c_skype</artifactId>
	  	<version>0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
  
+------------------------------------------------------------+
  
 <Congratulations> you are now ready to run some examples!
 
* Demonstration

** Usage Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Jens Hansen is an elderly patient who has a Net4Care powered device at his home, enabling him to perform daily measurements. He 
  has no former experience with computers whatsoever, hence the system has to be as simple as possible.

  Because of the fact that he most recently received this equipment, he is suppose to be in contact with a physician every 
  time he wishes to perform a new measurement. Therefore, as Jens go to his device to perform a measurement, he is met 
  with the single option, namely 'call hospital'. After pressing the call hospital button, Jens is informed to wait until the 
  hospital responds.
  Inside the hospital the physician Anders Jakobsen is responsible for aiding the Net4Care patients and has the Net4Care physician 
  application running on his personal computer. The application now alerts Anders with the message that Jens is ready to perform a new 
  measurement. Hans now has two options: the first option is to call Jens right away, otherwise it is possible to write a message 
  like for example 'You will get help with your measurement in no later than 2 minutes'.
  When Jens eventually receives a call from the hospital, his Net4Care application automatically accepts the call and makes the 
  new option 'perform measurement' available. At this point the physician and the patient is able to talk together to ensure a 
  valid measurement. When the measurement is performed then Net4Care ensures a proper handling and persistence of the data. 
  After the measurement is completed successfully the physician can look a history of previous measurements.
  When done, the physician hangs up and this resets the state of both patient and physician to their initial state.
  
** About the example code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

  Under n4c_example in the Net4Care source, you will find a folder named SkypeSpirometry. This folder contains code to perform 
  the above scenario.

  This example should preferably be run  
  on two different machines. Alternatively, have a VM running on top of your OS as the second machine. A third option is to 
  fake the behavior of one of the applications using the chat functionality of the official Skype program (does not matter if you use 
  the desktop version or the smartphone app), see: {{{How_to_run_Spirometry_example_using_only_one_machine}How to run spirometry example using only one machine}}.   
  
  Both applications takes some arguments.
  
  PatientApplication:
  
  * SkypeAccount
   
  * SkypePassword 
  
  * PhysicianSkypeAccount
  
  * Path to keypair
  
  []
  
  PhysicianApplication:
  
  * SkypeAccount
   
  * SkypePassword 
  
  * Path to keypair
  
  []
  
  
** Running SkypeSpirometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

  Fire up your SkypeKit runtime (as always when running SkypeKit applications). On windows you simple double-click the executable.
  
  More detail can be found at: {{http://developer.skype.com/skypekit/development-guide/java-tutorial/tutorial-guide-java}} step 5.

*** Using Maven only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

  Comiling the code: 

+-------------------------------------+
	/path_to_net4care/n4c_example/SkypeSpirometry/mvn clean install
+-------------------------------------+

  Now navigate to the application you want to start:

+-------------------------------------+
	/path_to_net4care/n4c_example/SkypeSpirometry/n4c_physician
+-------------------------------------+

  <<Or:>>
  
+-------------------------------------+
	/path_to_net4care/n4c_example/SkypeSpirometry/n4c_patient
+-------------------------------------+

  And edit the arguments passed to the application in pom.xml located inside this folder.
  Below is the part of n4c_patient/pom.xml where the arguments is passed:

+-------------------------------------+

	<!-- Patient skype account name -->
        <arg value="" />
        <!-- Patient skype account password -->
        <arg value="" />
        <!-- Physician skype account name -->
        <arg value="" />
        <!-- Path to keypair -->
        <arg value="" />
        
+-------------------------------------+

  <<Note:>> The path to keypair have to be an absolute path to a folder containing your two keypair files. Furthermore, the default 
  name of the key files are skypekit-cert and if your name differs, you should provide a full path to your .pem file.

  Now you are ready to run the example:

+-------------------------------------+
	mvn test
+-------------------------------------+

  The maven phase named test is normally used to run the junit tests that reside in src/test but since the antrun plugin 
  is configured to run during the test phase in pom.xml, the example code is run instead.


*** Using Eclipse

 At this point, following the steps above, you should have eclipse setup to use working sets and inside a working set have the n4c_skype project.
  
 Now lets compile the code:
  
+-------------------------------------+
	/path_to_net4care/n4c_example/SkypeSpirometry/mvn clean install eclipse:eclipse
+-------------------------------------+

  And import the three projects: n4c_data, n4c_patient and n4c_physician the same way that you imported n4c_skype.
  
  <<Note:>> If you forget to specify your working set when importing, then the projects most likely gets imported 
  to the working set 'Other Projects'. Simply drag the projects to your own working set if this happens.
  
  Your package explorer should look something like this:
  
[../images/eclipse_import_skypespirometry.png]

   
  Start either PatientApplication or PhysicianApplication with the correct arguments. The arguments are passed 
  by creating a run configuration for the application by:
  
+-------------------------------------+
	Right-click application->Run As->Run configuration 
+-------------------------------------+

  Here you have the option to run as a java application and pass the needed arguments.
  
  The arguments needed for PatientApplication are:
  
  * accountname
  
  * accountpassword
  
  * accountname of physician
  
  * an absolute path to the keypair
  
  []
  
    The arguments needed for PatientApplication are:
  
  * accountname
  
  * accountpassword
  
  * an absolute path to the keypair
  
  []
  
  Below is an image showing how to add the arguments.

**** How to run Spirometry example using only one machine

  Since both applications communicate through Skype using chat, it is possible to fake the behavior of both applications using 
  one of the official Skype programs.
  
  Below we use <<skypePatient>> and <<skypePhysician>> as examples of the two skype account names being used.
  
  It should be clear that both Spirometry example applications operate by moving from one fixed state to another, see {{{SkypeSpirometry_Screenshots}SkypeSpirometry Screenshots}}. 
  The states are described below with a comment on how make the application change state using an official Skype program:
  
  * Initial State

  <<skypePhysician>> waits for patients to take contact.

  * Patient pressed 'Contact the hospital'
  
  The initial message generated by the <<skypePatient>> when pressing 'Contact the hospital' is:

+-------------------------------------+
  [<ptName>:<ptCPR>] wishes to perform measurement
+-------------------------------------+

  Here the crucial part is [\<ptName\>:\<ptCPR\>] which is used by the <<skypePhysician>> later. So to 
  fake the initial contact by the <<skypePatient>>, use one of the following valid name and CPR pairs:

		* Nancy Berggren 251248-4916
		
		* Jens Hansen 120753-2355
		
		* Birgitte Roenholt 120753-2355
		
		* Birgitte Roenholt 030167-1648
		
		* Morten Larsson 210688-1111
		
		[]
		
		\ 
		 
  and write it in a chat message to <<skypePhysician>>.
  
  For instance:
	
+-------------------------------------+
  [<Jens Hansen>:<120753-2355>] wishes to perform measurement
+-------------------------------------+
  
  * Patient waiting for physician to become available
  
  * Physician pressed 'Call patient'
  
  To fake <<skypePhysician>>, simply place a call to <<skypePatient>>.
  
  * Physician has received measurements

  Since the handling of measurements is done by Net4Care code, the actual storage of measurements cannot be faked by 
  Skype. It is possible to make the application move to the next state though, simply by sending a chat message like:
  
+-------------------------------------+
  Spirometry measurements: \n FVC: 6.6 \n FEV1: 7.8
+-------------------------------------+
  
  []
