Unit, Integration, and System tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The framework contains tests at both unit-, integration-, and system
  level. 

Unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The bundle n4c_test contains a large number of unit tests that
  validate the behaviour of much of the individual units of the
  system. Most are automated tests that are part of the "mvn test"
  life-cycle.

  The special package org.net4care.scenario contains a small set of
  tests that are also learning tests that demonstrate how to configure
  test doubles so full end-to-end tests can be performed (upload of
  observations and query of the same) in a simulated environment.

Integration tests (Automatic)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
  The package org.net4care.integration contains test cases that
  assume a Net4Care server is running on port 8080 on localhost. These
  test cases are marked by 

  @Category(IntegrationTest.class)

  These test cases are not run as part of the usual maven life-cycle,
  rather you have to tell maven to run them:

+---
  mvn -P ci install
+---

Integration tests (Manual)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Client side

  For manual testing in various scenarios we have developed a home
  client test application (org.net4care.demo.ManualServerTest) that
  facilitate a larger set of test cases than the demonstrator programs
  do.

  The client allows contacting various servers, uploading spirometry
  data, and making queries based upon time interval, and finally
  validating the output format: JSON, PHMR, or using the graph
  plotting facilities.

* Server side

  To ease configuring the server side we have developed a non OSGi
  based server (org.net4care.main.ServerMain) which takes a single
  parameter. Valid parameter values are: "fast", "sql", or "xds". This
  parameter defines which implementation of the XDS interface is
  used. "fast" is a in-memory, non-persistent, data tier. "sql" is a
  persistent SQLite based data tier (the default of the OSGi based
  server), and finally "xds" connects via an adapter to a Microsoft
  open source XDS implementation that runs on a local machine on
  Computer Science, Aarhus University. Configuring the server for XDS
  will not work outside the Aarhus University campus network.


* Execution

  For windows there are .bat scripts in n4c_test to start both home
  client as well as server. Please review "run-manual-test.bat" and
  "run-server.bat". The latter takes a single argument, see above.

  
System tests 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The applications above can also serve as (almost) end-to-end
  testing.

  In addition, we have a Android-based weight application running on a
  Samsung tablet that allows you to enter your weight as a tele
  observation and upload it to the server. It also allows reviewing
  the uploaded weights. The source code is available by contacting the
  Net4Care team at <dev at net4care dot org>.
