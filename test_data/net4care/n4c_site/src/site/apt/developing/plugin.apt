Using the Net4Care Maven plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Overview
~~~~~~~~

 The Net4Care Maven plugin allows you to manage Net4Care servers in a
 cloud. Currently, Amazon EC2 is supported.

* Prerequisites

 See the {{{cloud}guide on using the Amazon EC2 command line tools}}
 with Net4Care for installation prerequisites.

 You may add the following to your POM to use the plugin

+----+
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.net4care</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-net4care-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+----+

 This is already added to {{{./../gettingstarted/hello.html}Hello,
 World!  tutorial}} POMs (TODO: implement). We are using the Hello, World!
 tutorial as a starting point in the following guide

** The ec2run goal

 The ec2run goal launches an Amazon instance where a Net4Care
 server may be run. (TODO: link to instance documentation)

 To invoke it, do the following:

+----+
cd com.smb.spirometry
mvn net4care:ec2run
+----+

 This will run an EC2 instance and report the DNS name when it
 finishes:
