Installing a Net4Care-based server in the Amazon EC2 cloud 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This document describes how to install a Net4Care server in Amazon
  EC2 (or an EC2-compatible cloud infrastructure) using the Amazon
  command line tools. 

* Prequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You should have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. There is an
  {{{http://aws.amazon.com/free/}AWS Free Usage Tier}} that you can
  sign up for. If you are signing up, you may want to familiarize
  yourself with the
  {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/}EC2
  Get Started guide}}. Here, we are, however, going to use the command
  line tools to set up a Net4Care-specific image.

  In the following, we also assume that you have the
  {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SettingUp_CommandLine.html}Amazon
  EC2 command line tools}} set up locally on your development machine
  and also that you are working in the EU West zone. Here is a
  skeleton of a .bashrc file that sets this up:

+---+
export EC2_HOME=<path>/ec2-api-tools/
export PATH=$PATH:$EC2_HOME/bin
export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=~/.ec2/pk-<id>.pem
export EC2_CERT=~/.ec2/cert-<id>.pem
export EC2_URL=http://ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
+---+

* Launching a basic Net4Care server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  We will launch a Net4Care-prepared EC2 instance (containing JDK,
  Maven, and Subversion) on which you should download and install
  Net4Care.

 You need a keypair to ensure that you can log into the instance. If
 you do not already have a key, you may create one in a terminal:

+---+
ec2-create-keypair gsg-net4care > gsg-net4care.pem
chmod 400 gsg-net4care.pem
+---+
  
 The instance needs to run in a security group which allows for
 incoming port 22 (SSH) and 8080 (HTTP) traffic. Again, you may create
 and configure one from the command line:

+---+
ec2-create-group net4care -d "Net4Care group"
ec2-authorize net4care -P tcp -p 8080 -s 0.0.0.0/0
ec2-authorize net4care -P tcp -p 22 -s 0.0.0.0/0
+---+

 Next, find the AMI id of the image:

+---+
ec2-describe-images -a --filter "name=Net4Care*" --filter "is-public=true"
+---+

 Start the instance with the appropriate key and security group:

+---+
ec2-run-instances <ami id> -k gsg-net4care -g net4care -t t1.micro
+---+

 When the instance is running (check with <<<ec2-describe-instances>>>
 and note the DNS address of the instance), you may log into the
 instance as the user "ec2-user" using SSH, e.g.,:

+---+
ssh -i gsg-net4care.pem ec2-user@<address>.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
+---+

* Install Net4Care on the EC2 instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You need to {{{./../gettingstarted/download.html}download}} and
  install Net4Care on the instance. To, e.g., install the current trunk, do:

+---+
svn checkout https://svn.nfit.au.dk/svn/net4care/trunk/src/net4care
cd net4care
mvn install
+---+

* Starting the Net4Care
~~~~~~~~~~~

  You should now start the Net4Care server on the instance:

+-----+
cd n4c_osgi/n4c_receiver
mvn pax:provision
+-----+

* Test the server
~~~~~~
  
  From a local machine, test that the Net4Care server is accessible (e.g., by doing

+-----+
curl <address>.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/observation
+-----+

  in a shell. This should return a response indicating that the server
  can indeed be reached from outside the instance firewall.)

* Terminate the EC2 instance
~~~~
  Remember to stop the server when it is not needed:

+---+
ec2-terminate-instances <instance id> 
+---+
