 The Net4Care platform provides the ability to quickly create quality
 tele-health applications interfacing with HL7 and IHE/XDS. Net4Care
 features a modular server- and client-side based on OSGi and aims at
 providing support for a telemedicine software ecosystem.

 A typical deployment scenario is a tele-monitoring scenario in which
 Net4Care clients are deployed in a gateway in private homes. Medical
 devices then connect to these gateways and transmit their
 observations to a Net4Care server. In turn the Net4Care server
 creates valid clinical HL7 documents, stores them in a national XDS
 repository, that in turn enables general practitioners and clinical
 staff to view observations.
