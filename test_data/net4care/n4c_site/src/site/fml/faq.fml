    <faq id="where">
      <question>Where did Maven come from?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Maven was created by a group of software developers who were tired
          of wasting their time fiddling around with builds and wanted to get
          down to brass tacks and actually develop software!

    <faq id="why">
      <question>Why is Maven so wildly popular?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Maven saves you so much time in your software development efforts that
          you will have time to learn a second language, relax ten hours a
          day, and train for that marathon you've always wanted to run!

      <question>How do I make Maven output more information when JUnit
      testcases fail?</question>
      <answer>
	<p>
Set the useFile property 
<br/>
mvn test -Dsurefire.useFile=false
<br/>

Now you can see line numbers within the failing test case in JUnit

    <faq id="windows-sqlite-db-inspect">
      <question>
	How do I inspect the SQLite DB's contents?
      </question>
      <answer>
	<p>
On Windows use the resources/sqlite3.exe on the db,
 for instance one test case stores in n4c_osgi/n4c_test/xdstest.db
 Use sqlite3.exe on this file which acts as a shell where you may
 query SQL. Read SQLiteXDSRepository.java for table layout.
<br/>
Nice commands:
<br/>

.tables = list all tables
<br/>

.schema = list all schemas

    <faq id="multiple-eclipse-project">
      <question>
	How do I keep two or more branches of the project in Eclipse?
      </question>
      <answer>
	<p>
	  This is pretty tricky as Eclipse cannot import two project
	  that have the same name; and as checking out another branch
	  does not rename a project, Eclipse refuses to have more than
	  one instance at the time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The trick is to rename the project(s) as several resources on
	  the web mention. Here is my recipe:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Checkout the branch using command-line SVN into a new
	    folder (or rather, just do not use Eclipse to do it)</li>
	    <li>Run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse'</li>
	    <li>For each of the subprojects (n4c_forwarder, etc.) edit
	    the .project file and do the renaming of the project in
	    the 'name' tag. For instance, I renamed all project names
	    from 'X' to 'X01' for a relase 0.1 branch.</li>
	    <li>Now import the folder into a new Eclipse working
	    set. This set will most likely have tons of compilation
	    errors because the build paths of each new project points
	    to the other projects in Eclipse with similar names. We
	    have to fix that.</li>
	    <li>For each project in the branch working set, fix the
	    build paths: menu project->properties; select java build
	    path; select tab properties; and remove all references to
	    project X and replace them with references to X01.</li>
	  </ol>
	  This should do it.

    <faq id="change port">
      <question>
        How do I change the default port (8080) of the jetty server?
      </question>
      <answer>
	<p>
		To change the default port from 8080 to 8082 add the following property to the pom.xml file:
		
		<pre>
		&lt;properties&gt;
		    	...
		    	&lt;org.osgi.service.http.port&gt;8082&lt;/org.osgi.service.http.port&gt;
		    	...
